        JavaScript primitive data types
        
        There are five types of primitive data types in JavaScript. They are as follows:
             string	represents sequence of characters e.g. "hello"
                Number	represents numeric values e.g. 100
                Boolean	represents boolean value either false or true
                Undefined	represents undefined value
                Null represents null i.e. no value at all

        JavaScript non-primitive data types
        The non-primitive data types are as follows:
                Object	represents instance through which we can access members
                Array	represents group of similar values
                RegExp	represents regular expression
    </p>
